Hello and welcome to this program that launches child processes from a parent process. 

Now I will tell you how to run it:

Step 1) Ensure that you have 3 files: user.c opp.c and makefile 

Step 2) Type "make" (no quotes) and a bunch of lines will generate from the makefile itself, if you see these it's a good sign, 
but you don't need to do anything with them

Step 3) Assuming all is working well, you should type "./oss -n (number 1-18) -s (number 1-18) -t (number).
n is the total number of child processes you want the system to launch
s is how many child processes at one time you want to allow for the system
t is the number of iterations you want the loop to perform
